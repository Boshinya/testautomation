# GreenApp QA Automation

The candidate needs to write a Selenium Webdriver test using Cucumber in Java to perform a critical test that will verify that the website https://e.ggtimer.com/ behaves as expected. The website has the ability to set a countdown timer of the users choosing in either seconds (default), minutes or hours. The time for this exercise should be time boxed to 1 hour.

## Things to consider

* Candidates can pair with the interviewer if they wish or perform the task on their own
* First create your new changes on a separate branch from master
* Once your changes are done, commit them and push them to the repository
* The test should run on Chrome or Firefox and pass 3 consecutive runs

What other scenarios could be tested for this application?
What improvements could be made to the test framework?
